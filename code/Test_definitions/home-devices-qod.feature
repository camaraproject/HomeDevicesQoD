Feature: CAMARA Home Devices QoD API, v0.4.0
  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * the maximum quantity of devices with non-default QoS behaviour
  # * RSSI allowed threshold
  # * maximum QoS (service class value) allowed
  # * home network occupancy threshold
  # * supported router interfaces and frequency bands in WiFi interface
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * A home device connected to the user home network identified by its IPv4 address
  # * A home device connected to a specific frequency band that does not match to the required interface
  # * A home device that does not support the required interface
  # * A home device with RSSI is below allowed threshold
  # * A user home network with the maximum quantity of devices with non-default QoS behaviour
  # * A user home network with the occupancy above the allowed threshold
  # * A user home network with the router offline
